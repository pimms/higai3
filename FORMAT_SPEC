# First, we define the topology. The format is:
# 	[number of layers] [layer0-real-nodes] [layer0-bias-nodes] ... [layerN...]
# This example network has two layers. The input layer has one input node
# and one bias node. The output layer has two real nodes and no
# bias nodes.
[2] [1][1] [2][0]

# Then the weights for LAYER1-LAYERN are defined sequentially. 
# The format is:
# 	{real-node0}..{real-nodeN}{bias-node0}..{bias-nodeN}
# The input layer has no incoming connections and therefore no weights. The output
# layer has two nodes in the previous layer, so all nodes must define
# two weights each. The receiving layer is responsible for defining the weights.
