# THIS IS NOT A VALID FILE. THE FORMAT IS ASCII. NUMBERS SPECIFIED IN

# ARE ALLOWED. NO EMPTY LINES ARE ALLOWED.

# First, we define the topology. The format is:
# 	[number of layers] [layer0-real-nodes] [layer0-bias-nodes] ... [layerN...]
# This example network has two layers. The input layer has one input node
# and one bias node. The output layer has two real nodes and no
# bias nodes. There must at least be two layers. There is no upper limit 
# on anything, but don't be stupid about it. 
[2] [2][1] [2][0]

# There are two different ways of generating the weights.
# - Randomly
# - Predefined
#
# The next word will define which type is used. Either of the following
# two is ok:
# 	"RAND"		The weights will be randomly generated. 
# 	"PREDEF"	The weights must be defined as described below.


# RANDOM FORMAT
# The minimum and maximum weight must be defined following the
# "RAND"-symbol. In this example, all weights will be given a weight
# between -1 and 1, inclusive.
RAND
-1.0 1.0

# PREDEFINED FORMAT
# Then the weights for LAYER1-LAYERN are defined sequentially. 
# The format is:
# 	{real-node0}..{real-nodeN}{bias-node0}..{bias-nodeN}
# The input layer has no incoming connections and therefore no weights. The output
# layer has two nodes in the previous layer, so all nodes must define
# two weights each. The receiving layer is responsible for defining the weights.
PREDEF
{0.7} {0.1} {0.3}
{9.3} {0.5} {1.3}
